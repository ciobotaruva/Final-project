      "description": "It's amazing how little the €900 Galaxy S20 sacrifices compared to its €1,000+ bigger sibling and even the S20 Ultra, which starts at €1,300.The S20 and S20+ are so incredibly similar that the choice between the two comes down to size preference. Especially if you are in no rush to hop on the 5G early-adopter bandwagon since the vanilla S20 is available in a 4G configuration and a incomplete 5G one (Sub-6 only). Similarly, if you are not a photography buff, or the type of person to always go for the best out there, the S20 Ultra isn't the sensible choice.",

      "description": "We've lived long enough to see a scaled-down version of the phone that opened the world's eyes to the concept of big phones - meet the Samsung Galaxy Note10. The original Note lives on in the 10+, but the Note10, size small, is the Note for those that didn't think they wanted a Note.Barely larger than the Galaxy S10 and appreciably more compact than the S10+, the Galaxy Note10 has die-hard Note loyalists reaching for their pitchforks - Notes need to be bigger than the S-series, that's the norm. But if such reasoning stems from a time with one device in each of Samsung's high-end lineups, what's wrong with a double-Note double-S state of affairs (let's pretend for a minute the S10e doesn't exist for the sake of this argument)?The Note10 features a 6.3-inch display - that's 0.2 inches more than the S10, which you could count as a modern loophole in the laws of the Galaxy universe allowing it to carry the Note badge even if it's smaller than the S10+. The 1080p resolution is what's a bit more troubling - the S10's smaller screen is QHD, and so is the Note10+'s 6.8-incher - that's one in favor of the 'this isn't a Note' team, which also proclaim that Notes need to be equipped with the best available hardware. And this one isn't quite there. But it's got plenty nonetheless.",

      "description": "What is a Samsung Galaxy Note to you? If you understand it to be an ultra-high-end smartphone with a stylus, then the latest Galaxy Note10 Lite will have you disappointed. Not on the stylus front - it's got an S Pen alright, but on the top-level hardware. Let's try and figure out what the Galaxy Note10 Lite is and isn't.It isn't a true flagship, that should be evident. For one, it's powered by a two-year-old chipset - yes, it's a high-end chipset, but it's still from the S9 times. Then there's the display, a FullHD-only AMOLED that is just Super, but not Dynamic, and not even Plus like on the Galaxy S10 Lite.A few other top-tier niceties are gone as well - there's no IP rating on the Galaxy Note10 Lite and no Gorilla Glass is mentioned explicitly, a single speaker fires out the bottom, wireless charging coils are missing, and the fingerprint reader is a bit slower than the one on the flagships. Storage is UFS 2.1, unlike the Note10's speedier 3.0 and there less of it - 128GB is the only option, which is half the real Notes' standard equipment, while RAM is an unthinkable (/s) 6 gigs in the base trim, 8GB tops. So no - not a flagship this one.But... it does have the S Pen, and styluses are hard to come by in today's smartphones. Perhaps best of all, the Lite comes with the biggest battery on a Galaxy Note (smartphone, the Note tablets don't count) - a 4,500mAh powerpack managed to fit in here despite the S Pen silo getting in the way. The Note10 Lite is also packing a really promising camera system with a standard trio on the back (wide, ultra wide, short tele) and a big sensor/high-res selfie unit.",

      "description": "If 2019 taught us anything it's that Samsung's A-series span pretty much the entire spectrum of feature sets and price brackets short of a true flagship. The 2020 roster is only beginning to unfold and the company kicked things off by adding 1s to product names in the mid-tier - thus the Galaxy A51 was born.That 1 means a lot when you look at the A51 and A50 side by side. For starters, there's 1 more camera on the new model - a close-focusing 5MP shooter. The chipset is also 1 better - the A51 is powered by the Exynos 9611 as opposed to the 9610 in last year's phone. And then a 0.1-inch increase in screen diagonal continues the theme albeit at a lower order of magnitude.Let's put our lame attempts at numerology to the side, and mention the other upgrades that the Galaxy A51 brings - almost exclusively in the camera system. There's a 48MP Quad Bayer primary unit now replacing the 25MP conventional module of the A50 and the ultra wide-angle cam's sensor has grown in pixel count - it now stands at 12MP as opposed to the A50's 8MP, still with 123-degree coverage.And you be the judge if this counts as an upgrade, but the selfie camera now sits in a cutout in the top center of the display, unlike the A50's notch. Infinity-O replaces Infinity-U. The camera itself should, indeed, qualify as an upgrade - a 32MP Quad Bayer unit where the A50's 25MP snapper used to sit.",

      "description": "The Samsung Galaxy A-series are going through a bit of an identity crisis with J-style metal replacing the glass in the lower end of the lineup. But we already knew that - we had the A6 (2018) in for review just last month. Now it's the plus's turn - the Galaxy A6+ (2018) brings more than just a bigger display. Well, for one, it's also higher-res - 1080p vs. the non-plus's 720p, and it's one of those Samsung-style 1080p's with an 18.5: 9 aspect. Super AMOLED, naturally, and notchelss too - yay! There's also a secondary camera on the back - a 5MP depth-sensing module is there to assist the main 16MP shooter (shared between this year's As) in taking blurred background portraits. Meanwhile, a 50% bump in pixel count sees the A6+ sporting a 24MP front-facing camera - all of a sudden the 16MP selfies of the A6 don't look that impressive. With a larger display comes the need for a higher battery capacity and the plus delivers - 3, 500mAh sounds plenty. Couple that with an efficient, if not too brawny,14nm Snapdragon 450 chipset and we could be looking at some pretty great endurance.The Galaxy A6+ (2018) ticks some other important checkboxes too - there's a dedicated microSD slot on top of the twin nano SIM bay, a fingerprint reader on the back ensures some security, and a 3.5mm jack means you can connect your choice of headphones. And use them as the antenna for the FM radio, because there's a receiver for that, too.",
